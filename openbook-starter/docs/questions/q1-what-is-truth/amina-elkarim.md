# What is truth?

> *This chapter is part of the global question series. Every voice is welcome.*

## Introduction  
For me, truth is like light: it shows what is already there.  

## Personal Context  
I grew up in Morocco, in a Muslim family where the Qur’an was often recited at home.  

## Exploration  
Truth has two layers: **outer** (facts, science) and **inner** (meaning, heart).  

## Conclusion  
Truth is both the light of reason and the whisper of the soul.

## Optional Add-ons  
- **One-sentence wisdom:** “Truth is the bridge between what we see and what we feel.”
